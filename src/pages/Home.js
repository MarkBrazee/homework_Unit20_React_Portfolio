      <p>
        I am an Oregon native. I've been married to my beautiful wife, Leigh,
        for 30 years. We have two wonderful children, Tyler and Alyssa. I have
        lived in Aurora, Colorado for 25 years. I am an University of Oregon
        graduate, Go Ducks! I am a former Aurora Academy Charter School School
        Board Member. I am concerned about the earth and what my children will
        inherit from previous generations. I am an avid cyclist, riding 2,000 to
        3,000 miles a year. I am looking to augment or change my professional
        background after 30 years in the architectural industry. I love to ride
        in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. I would love to ride in the French,
        Swiss and Italian Alps someday, soon. I am a long time Colorado Rockies
        and Seattle Mariners fan. I am a Star Wars and Star Trek fan. This is
        the Way and Live Long and Prosper. I would like to be at the beach. I am
        a life-long Democrat. I am looking to augment or change my professional
        background after 30 years in the architectural industry.
